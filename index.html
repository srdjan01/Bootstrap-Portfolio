							<p>My name is Srdjan Markovich.  I was born in Bosnia and immigrated to the United States a little over fifteen years ago with my family.  We came to this country due to civil unrest that was within my country and surrounding territories.  In my short time here, I have had the opportunity to do and experience many things.

								<p>When I am not working as a System Engineer at Intel or studying full stack web development, I enjoy spending time with my friends and squeezing in as many activities as I can.  Some of these activities are going to the gym, practicing yoga, biking local trails and entertaining my two young Siberian Huskies: Noni and Sia.  I also enjoy traveling and visiting locations that have nice beaches that I can lay on without care for hours on end.  My favorite beaches that I have visited since being in the United States have been on Maui, Hawaii and Cancun, Mexico.</p>

								<p>My goal is to complete the full stack web development bootcamp and move within Intel to a position that I can use these skills.  Intel is large and there is endless opportunity for me within the organization to use these skills and further develop my career.  I am hopeful that I will be doing this for some time to come.</p>
